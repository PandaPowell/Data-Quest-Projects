The dataset is on sold houses in Ames, Iowa. Each row in the dataset describes the properties of 
a single house as well as the amount it was sold for. In this course, we'll build models that predict the 
final sale price from its other attributes. Specifically, we'll explore the following questions:

Which features of a house best predict its final sale price?
How effectively can we predict the sale price from just its properties?

This dataset was originally compiled by Dean De Cock for the primary purpose of having a high quality dataset for regression.
