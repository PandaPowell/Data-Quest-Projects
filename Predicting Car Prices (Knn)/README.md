The dataset we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information 
about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles 
per gallon, and how fast the car accelerates. Using this information we will predict the price of the car.

The dataset is hosted by the University of California Irvine on their machine learning repository.
